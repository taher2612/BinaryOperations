  -> def binTo2sComplement<br>
  -> def isNegative<br>
  -> def addBinary<br>
  -> def shiftRight<br>
  -> def shiftLeft<br>
  
### Class Methods: (These class methods act as alternate constructors)
  -> def replicate<br>
  -> def replicate2sComplement<br>
  -> def nBitBinary<br>
  -> def equalize<br>
  
### Dunder Method:
  -> def __str__<br>
